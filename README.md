# The 5zig Mod

This repository contains the core of The 5zig Mod.  
Given the nature of the project, this repository must only contain **version-independent** code.

Version-exclusive code should be stored inside the [version-support](https://github.com/5zig-revived/version-support) repo.

# Building
First, clone the repository:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/5zig-revived/The-5zig-Mod
```
Then, build using Gradle:
```
./gradlew build
```

You can find the resulting artifacts in the `version-specific/VERSION/build/libs` folder,
where `VERSION` is the version you desire.
